# **Authentication**

1- Password Hashing
We used Laravel's built-in system to securely hash all user passwords before storing them in the database. This ensures that even if the database is compromised, no one can read the real passwords.

2- User Role Assignment
Each user is automatically assigned a role (like patient) when they register. This role helps determine what pages or actions the user is allowed to access.

3- Secure Registration with Fortify
Instead of manually handling registration, we used Laravel Fortify, which provides secure and ready-to-use login, registration, and validation features.

4- Strong Password Validation
During registration, users must use strong passwords that meet security requirements (like minimum length, characters, etc.), helping to protect against easy-to-guess passwords.

5- Input Validation
We ensured that all user input during registration is properly validated, so only clean and correct data is saved into the system.

# **Authorization**

1- Custom Role Middleware
We created a custom middleware to check a user's role before allowing access to specific pages. For example, only an admin can access the admin dashboard.

2- Route Protection by Role
Certain routes (like admin or doctor pages) are protected using this middleware, so only users with the correct role can view them. Others will get a "403 Forbidden" error.

3- Middleware Registration
We registered the custom middleware in the Laravel system so it can be used across any route in the application.

4- Tested Role Access
We tested the system by logging in as different roles (admin, doctor, patient) to confirm that each role can only access its allowed pages.
